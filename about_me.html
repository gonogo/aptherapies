<h1>Alison Pryke &mdash; About Me</h1>

<p>I have been a practising Sports and Remedial Massage Therapist for a number of years.  My work is not confined to the prevention and treatment of sports-related injuries; many clients have conditions such as RSI (repetitive strain injury); chronic neck, shoulder and back pain or other symptoms of muscle over-use.</p>
<p>I have also worked with people with degenerative conditions such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, having found that massage can help bring relief to some of the distressing symptoms associated with these disorders.</p>
<p>I have my own practice in Holt, near Trowbridge. </p>
